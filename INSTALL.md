# Installing Berlussimo

This document describes how to install Berlussimo on a server. Berlussimo is a web application, currently consisting of 
two main parts: 

* A legacy forms based web application
* A single page web application backed by a GraphQL API

To drive these two parts, multiple processes are needed. The processes are isolated into `docker` containers. The 
containers are orchestrated by `docker-compose`. The installation is split into the following parts:

* [Prerequisite Software](#prerequisite-software)
* [Install](#install)
* [Development](#development)

## Prerequisite Software

Before you can install Berlussimo, you must install and configure the
following products on your server:

* [docker-engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) to run the different processes of berlussimo

* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to orchestrate the different processes of berlussmio

## Install

### Download `docker-compose` files

Download the `docker-compose` files. These files hold all information to start the docker containers of berlussimo.

```shell
# Download config and .env file:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerlusGmbH/Berlussimo/feature/graphql/docker/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerlusGmbH/Berlussimo/feature/graphql/docker/.env.example

# Rename .env.example to .env
mv .env.example .env
```

Generate two keys and assign them in `.env` to `APP_KEY` and `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`

```
$ docker run --rm berlus/berlussimo-fpm:dev php artisan key:generate --show
Application key set successfully.
Pusher application key set successfully.
Encryption keys generated successfully.

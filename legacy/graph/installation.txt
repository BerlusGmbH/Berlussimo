Thank you for downloading SVGraph.

Please unzip all the files to a folder in the document root of your webserver.

The only thing you have to do to use SVGraph is to include the file "SVGraph.php" to your project,
e.g. by writing

	require('path/to/SVGraph/SVGraph.php');
	
. If you do so, all SVGraph classes and methods should be available.

An overview of all methods can be found here: http://slauth.de/projekte/SVGraph/api
